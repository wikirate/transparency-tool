For each product, the brand is aware of the cost of raw material, labour minutes and in general, has an understanding of the costs of every department at the factory. The labour costs indicated by the factory where found logical are fixed and are not discussed or negotiated. The brand uses an excel based price simulator to evaluate and arrive at price changes. For example, when the minimum wage went up in Bangladesh the brand already discussed and agreed on a new increased price with their suppliers.
